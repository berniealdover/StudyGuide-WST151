            <h3>Markup Language</h3>
            <p>
              In the context of the internet and computers, a markup language is
              a system for marking up or annotating a digital document so that
              the information it it can be structured for more easy access and
              manipulation.

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              Hardware and software technologies that help visually or
              physically impaired people to use the computer.

            <h3>Domain Name</h3>
            <p>
              A Domain Name is a unique label for an entity of the internet.

            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>
              The Domain Name System organizes the internet by identifying the
              address and type of entity. It also converts domain names into IP
              addresses that can be understood by machines comprising the
              Internet.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Hypertext Markup Language is the language used for creating web
              pages and web applications. HTML has a specified tag set for
              semantically describing the structure of a web page. HTML elements
              are the building blocks of a web page and are defined by tags
              written using angle brackets.

            <h3>Internet</h3>
            <p>
              The internet is an interconnected network of computer networks
              that spans the globe. Today it is a major part of our lives.

            <h3>IETF</h3>
            <p>
              The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the principal body
              engaged in the development of new Internet protocol standard
              specifications.

            <h3>MIME</h3>
            <p>
              Clients and servers often need to indicate the type of file being
              transferred so they know how to handle them. MIME is a standard
              that helps to classify the types of files used on the internet.

            <h3>RFC</h3>
            <p>
              A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document from the
              Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) that is the result of
              committee drafting and subsequent review by interested parties.
              Some RFCs are informational in nature. Of those that are intended
              to become Internet standards, the final version of the RFC becomes
              the standard and no further comments or changes are permitted.
              Change can occur, however, through subsequent RFCs that supersede
              or elaborate on all or parts of previous RFCs.

            <h3>TLD</h3>
            <p>
              Domain names have at least 2 parts separated by a period. The
              right-most part of a domain name is called the top-level domain
              (TLD).TLDs can be used to classify domains and indicate what type
              of website the domain name is poitning to.They can be generic like
              .com and .net or they can be country codes like .fr or .zw. The
              organization currently responsible for country code top-level
              domains (ccTLDs) and generic top-level domains (gTLDs) is IANA,
              which is a function of ICANN.

            <h3>URL</h3>
            <p>
              A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a URI with the location of the
              resource included. URLs for internet resources include the
              protocol, domain name, and path to the file on the server.

            <h3>W3</h3>
            <p>
              The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)Takes a proactive role in
              developing recommendations and prototype technologies related to
              the Web. These recommendations are not rules but guidelines. Major
              software companies that build web browsers, such as Microsoft, do
              not always follow W3C Recommendations. This makes life challenging
              for web developers because not all browsers will display a web
              page in exactly the same way.

            <h3>XML</h3>
            <p>
              XML is a human and machine readable markup language for storing
              and transporting data. It looks very similar to HTML, having
              opening and closing tags with attributes, but the tags are user
              defined. Developers can create any tag they need to describe
              information. All xml documents must have a root element. XML is
              not a replacement or alternative to HTML.
